# FRC-8303
  We are the robotics team of Decatur High School, Federal Way, Washington. Here we are posting backups and up-to-date coding files for posterity and future teams. Please post some form of credit if you use this code in your own projects.

  For future teams: You may code in the "src" folder in java. Save your WPILib code in the "WPILib Tools Folder" by creating a folder called "YEAR"(replace with year number) with your coding folder called "8303-YEAR_CODE"(replace with year number). To update the code please enter into the right repository on github for your year. Once you are in the right year, go to the but do not enter "src" folder in the repository and upload your "src" folder on your computer and upload it.
